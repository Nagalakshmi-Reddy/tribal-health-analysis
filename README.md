# 📊 Tribal & Rural Health Analysis

A data-driven project analyzing health infrastructure, ICDS service utilization, and perinatal outcomes among tribal and rural communities in India. This project highlights disparities across social groups and provides actionable insights to improve equitable healthcare access.

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project focuses on evaluating disparities in healthcare access among Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, OBCs, and other social categories using publicly available data from the Government of India (NDAP Portal). It covers:

- Health infrastructure adequacy (PHCs, CHCs, subcentres)
- Maternal and child health service utilization during pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Supplementary nutrition delivery via Anganwadi Centres
- Perinatal outcomes such as stillbirths and early neonatal deaths

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – End-to-end project execution and insights
- **PDF** – Final report for NGOs, public health orgs, or fellowship applications

## 📌 Key Insights

- CHCs are significantly overburdened, with population coverage exceeding national norms.
- Scheduled Tribes receive relatively better maternal and nutrition services; however, OBCs and ‘Other’ groups are underserved.
- Over 70% of women receive no services during pregnancy and breastfeeding across most groups.
- Neonatal deaths outnumber stillbirths, highlighting a postnatal care gap.
- Service awareness and delivery are inconsistent, especially in marginalized groups.

## ✅ Recommendations

- Strengthen CHC infrastructure and staffing.
- Recruit more male health workers in rural areas.
- Improve ICDS outreach for underserved categories (OBC, SC, Others).
- Enhance nutrition delivery consistency at Anganwadi Centres.
- Fix inconsistencies in data classification (e.g., “Don’t Know”, “Other”).
